# CKJ Portfolio
_by Chris Knight Johnson_

## Usage
The "business card" area serves as a landing page with basic contact information. A link at the top will toggle content to show the projects gallery page. Each gallery card is a link that will eventually link to other projects.

## Architecture
The card landing page section will be initially shown. When the button to view the gallery is clicked they will change visibility, and trade spaces as a result.

### >> Flexbox
Nav links in the fixed top of the page, the upper and lower contact details on the contact section, and the gallery cards in the portfolio section use display: flex for positioning.

## Tech Used
jQuery 3.2.1 is used to toggle content on the site and toggle classes on the jackalope image. Sass is used to generate font sizes. CSS3 transitions are used for a smooth repositioning of the jackalope image.
